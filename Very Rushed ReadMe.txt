3D tank wars 2

-----------------
     Read me
-----------------

1) Don't rip it off. Please

2) You can use this code how you like, 
   so long as my name is on it (Mark Burgess)

3) To play, select a level, and move the mose around the screen
   to drive your tank. Click on the screen to fire forwards

4) Once everything is dead, you'll have to quit and run again

5) Once your board, try making your own levels

6) Stand by for a better version written in C++

7) The COMMAND menu will only really work on the level named
   'Level1.txt' It is used to set the planes targets. If I ever do
   a final version, there will be two teams of tanks, and you will
   be able to give your team orders like on UnReal.

8) You can't kill the planes yet, cos you can't shoot into the sky

9) 3D Tank dosn't shut down right. Do a Ctrl Alt Del after you've
   run it, and its still there. Select it and press end task to get
   rid of it. Sorry.

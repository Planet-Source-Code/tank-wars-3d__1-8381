## Tank Wars 3D


</div>

### Description

This is a 3D demo that is writen in much simpler language than anything I have found. I this that it will be alot easier for someone learning 3D to figure this out than some of the stuff on the net.

I'd Like 2 Thanx Shaid Benaris - Da VB6 - onwards professional gangsta - Thuglife
 
### More Info
 
Well, you can choose what level to play....And, er, dirve around and shoot stuff

Nothing. This code should point you in the right direction if your learning 3D

Its intended to return some satisfaction, but this is only gained on fast machines. Still, its just a working project

Distractions from important stuff, like out-of-date course work
